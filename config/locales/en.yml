  lesson1:
    p1: |
        We'll start by learning two basic elements in text formatting: <em>italics</em>
        and <strong>bold</strong>. In these lessons, you'll notice some <code>formatted red text</code>;
        this text is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any different
        than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make it easier to see.
    p2: |
        To make a phrase <em>italic</em> in Markdown, you can surround words with an
        underscore (<code>_</code> ). For example, <code>_this_</code> word would become
        <em>italic</em>.
    p3: |
        For this next lesson, make the word "not" italic.
    p4: Awesome! Great job.
    p5: |
        Similarly, to make phrases <strong>bold</strong> in Markdown, you can surround
        words with two asterisks ( <code>**</code> ). This will <code>**really**</code>
        get your point across.
    p6: In the box below, make the word "will" bold.
    p7: Good work!
    p8: |
        Of course, you can use <code>_both italics and bold_</code> in the same line.
        You can also span them <code>**across multiple words**</code>.
    p9: In the box below, make the words "Of course" italic, and the words "a little moxie" bold.
    p10: Fantastic!
    p11: |
         For the final exercise in this lesson, we're going to make some words <em>bold
         <strong>and</strong> italic</em>.
    p12: |
         In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores.
         In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic.
         Place the asterisks <code>**_on the outside_**</code>, just to make it more legible.
    p13: Now you know how to make things bold and italic in Markdown!
